# Roomie

A roommate finding service specifically for students at the University of Texas at Austin. 

## Inspiration
I decided to make this site because I didn't like the other options UT students had to find roommates, especially for people who are new to the community, like me. RoomSurf looked good at first, but it's not easy to narrow down the search and profiles are openly visible to everyone. The Facebook group looked like the other best option, especially since only students could enter, but it lacked the benefits of RoomSurf. Roomie is my nascent attempt at a service that combines the best of both platforms.

## Tools Used
1. SvelteJS and SpectreCSS for the frontend
2. Actix-Web for the server
3. Meilisearch for the database and search engine

## Contributions
If you would like to contribute, open up an issue on this repo, please. You will likely be unable to run the complete server on your own until you've initialized environment variables using a .env file. These are currently undocumented.
